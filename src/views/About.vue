        I’m <strong>Miguel López</strong>, a game developer and programmer based in <strong>Sevilla</strong>, passionate about bringing ideas to life. I’m all about Unity, but I don’t just stick to programming or just Unity—I’m involved in every aspect of creating games.

      <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
        With <strong>15+ years of experience</strong> in the industry, I got started because I love how games combine art with tech, and let’s be honest—playing them is just incredibly fun!

        I co-founded <a href="https://koronstudios.com">Koron Studios</a>, a game company we built from the ground up, and after 7 years of blood, sweat and pixels, we sold it to explore new challenges (no Forbes article, but I’ll take the pride in everything we accomplished as a team). This journey gave me a ton of invaluable experience and knowledge.

        Now, I'm working at <a href="https://odderslab.com">Odders Lab</a>, diving into the world of Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality for the awesome fitness brand <strong>Les Mills</strong>.

        When I’m not coding, you’ll find me smashing padel balls, soaking up the sun on a terrace with friends, or jumping into a game jam to experiment with fresh ideas and ways to create awesome games.
